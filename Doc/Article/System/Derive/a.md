# System Derive

Class uses PC hardware, Internet subscription, Windows operating system, C# programming language, .NET CLI, Qt C++ framework, 
C programming language, C++ programming language.
Class layers on top of these in system architecture.
The system architecture is a derive of the ideal system architecture.
Modules made from module sources in Class, layers on top of this system.

This system derive, Class does not have BaseOperate in its lang elements.
It has BaseGetOperate, BaseCallOperate, BaseSetTarget to use base class comps. 
This Class does not allow null to be assigned to builtin Bool and Int classes ref holders.

This system derive, does not have builtin audio tune effect to be used by modules.
It also does not have builtin video 3D draw effect to be used by modules.
It also does not have builtin media creation effect to be used by modules.

This system derive has file system path for any entry that is file or fold.
This system derive has builtin storage arrange effect for files and folds.
This system derive storage of any module is open to any module.

This system derive uses millisecond as the smallest time unit.

This system derive takes up space when it is not being used.
This system derive has weight.
This system derive consumes energy when it is operating.
