# System Modules

Class has system modules that provide users facilities to do input and output.
The facilities are in classes in system modules.

The system modules include storage and network input and output. 
It also includes frame to get typing and mouse input, and provides drawing classes to draw on image and frame.
A frame is a window in Windows.

The system modules classes have execute certainty enough to be used in any module that needs high execute certainty.

The system modules classes have abstract enough for their purposes so that they are suitable to be used for their purposes without additional wrapping. 

The system modules have names including module names and class names in their abstract that are node names.

The system modules provide facilities for developing modules that use enterprise models, and use viewing of the models.
The models include entities that have unbounded ranges of purposes.

The system module with module name System.Draw has drawing classes to draw 2D primitives. The classes can draw model diagrams including 2D view of anything in model. They can draw model diagrams that are maps.
Class language elements and system modules classes can be used to view, store, and transfer model diagrams.
Modules can output info by storing and transferring models in text and models in diagram.
Models in text and in diagram are sufficient ways to represent info effectively. One of the reason they are effective is that they can be presented in video without using 3D visual. Users have no need to interpret 3D visual that way.
