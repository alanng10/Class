# System Module

Class has system infra modules and compiler modules.

The system modules classes have execute certainty enough to be used in any module that needs high execute certainty.

The system modules classes have abstract enough for their purposes so that they are suitable to be used for their purposes without additional wrapping. 

The system modules have names including module names and class names in their abstract that are node names.

The system modules abstract names have meanings that cover wholely and entirely the entities that the names refer to.
The system modules abstract entities are general to cover classes of different input and output.
The entities in total cover all ranges of all effects.
The entities do not overlap.
The entities have highest non duplicate.
The entities also have highest modularity.
Modularity is grouping of entities for different purposes of uses.
The grouping in the system modules is for the easiest uses for human minds use tools.

System infra modules abstracts are not tagged with the existence of specific operating system, or system programming language.
