Class is an all purpose programming language.
Class is used to create modules.
Class consists of infra modules, compiler modules, execution runner, documentation, source code.
Class is open source.
Permission is granted to every person to use any copy of this software in any way.<br /><br />
Class is an object oriented programming language.
It uses classes to define any entity.
Any entity can be defined by a class.
Abstract of an entity is the define of the entity.
A class can be any abstract.<br /><br />
Class is high level programming language.
Class does not need manual memory management when the user develops in the language.
Class uses auto memory management, that releases memory that are not used automatically.<br /><br />
Class does class checking when compiling source code.
All classes are checked when they are used, and when the variables are assigned.<br /><br />
Class outputs module binary when compiling.
The module binary is a machine code library.
The module binary is executed with execution runner.<br /><br />
Class has documentation that includes programming guide, system architecture, and API reference.<br /><br />
Class as a platform is best platform to develop because it has best and easiest use lang elements and builtin infra.
Class has highest develop speed order.
It is also best to make abstract.
Class modules can abstract any effect. It is best to abstract any effect.<br /><br />
Class is a tool to humans.
