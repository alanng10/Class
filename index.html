Class is a general purpose programming language.
Class is used to create modules.
Class consists of compiler modules, system modules, documentation, source code.
Class is open source.
Permission is granted by Class creator that is me, Alan Ng Jen Foong, to every person to use any copy of Class in any way.<br /><br />
Class is an object-oriented programming language.
It uses classes to define any entity.
Any entity can be defined by a class.
Abstract of an entity is the define of the entity.
A class can be any abstract.<br /><br />
Class is high level programming language.
Class does not need manual memory management when the user develops in the language.
Class uses auto memory management, that is same in C#.<br /><br />
Class does class checking when compiling source code.
All classes are checked when they are used, and when the variables are assigned.<br /><br />
Class outputs module binary when compiling.
The module binary is a C# assembly binary.
The module binary is executed on .NET runtime.<br /><br />
Class has documentation that includes programming guide, system architecture, and API reference.<br /><br />
Class as a platform is best platform to develop because it has best and easiest use lang elements and builtin infra.
It is also best to make abstract.
Class modules can abstract any effect. It is best to abstract any effect.<br /><br />
Class is a tool to humans.
