Modules made by Class have module names in their abstract. They also can have class names, field names, maide names and var names in their abstract.
The names can be any node names.
Node names are names that are words that cover exactly the ranges of the purposes of the entities the names refer to.<br /><br />
Node names are sufficient for any abstract.
Abstract is to be referred by names. Names in abstract only need to cover exactly all the purposes of the entities they refer to.
The purposes of the entities are what the entities are.
Abstract is best represented by names that have meanings that are what the entities are.
If the names have additional meanings than what the entities are, the names do not have the meanings that are what the entities are.
