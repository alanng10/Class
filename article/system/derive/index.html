Class uses PC hardware, Internet subscription, Windows operating system, C# programming language, .NET CLI, Qt C++ framework, 
C programming language, C++ programming language.
Class layers on top of these in system architecture.
The system architecture is a derive of the ideal system architecture.
Modules made from module sources in Class, layers on top of this system.<br /><br />
This system derive, does not have builtin audio tune effect to be used by modules.
It also does not have builtin video 3D draw effect to be used by modules.
It also does not have builtin media creation effect to be used by modules.<br /><br />
This system derive uses millisecond as the smallest time unit.<br /><br />
This system derive takes up space when it is not being used.
This system derive has weight.
This system derive consumes energy when it is operating.
