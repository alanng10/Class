Class uses PC hardware, Internet subscription, Windows operating system, C# programming language, .NET CLI, Qt C++ framework, 
C programming language, C++ programming language.
Class layers on top of these in system architecture.
The system architecture is a derive of the ideal system architecture.
Modules made from module sources in Class, layers on top of this system.<br /><br />
This system derive, Class does not have BaseOperate in its lang elements.
It has BaseGetOperate, BaseCallOperate, BaseSetTarget to use base class comps. 
This Class precate count does not allow derive classes comps base class ref holders that are not base keywords
to use the precate comp.
This Class CastOperate does class hierarchy checking at compile time.
This Class does not allow null to be assigned to builtin Bool and Int classes ref holders.
Assigning builtin Bool and Int anys to Any class ref holders will have memory allocation.
Builtin Bool, Int and String anys called Init maide with Any class ref holders will have run time error.
Casting Any class ref holders to builtin Bool and Int class will have value false and 0 if the castings fail.<br /><br />
This system derive, does not have builtin audio tune effect to be used by modules.
It also does not have builtin video 3D draw effect to be used by modules.
It also does not have builtin media creation effect to be used by modules.<br /><br />
This system derive uses millisecond as the smallest time unit.<br /><br />
This system derive takes up space when it is not being used.
This system derive has weight.
This system derive consumes energy when it is operating.
