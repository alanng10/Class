# Tool

Tool is Class module list for any tool.

Tool is a form from set module entry in modules.

Set module entry in modules does not tag the modules abstract with existence of specific form.
The entries are ports in modules.

Tool has infra element enough to make any tool.

Tool parts can be replaced with derived parts.
To replace with derived parts, set derived parts classes instances in tool module entry fields before entry ExecuteMain executes.
Different module entries that use derived part classes instances can be generated with module that uses Class compiler modules.

Using network local system to load any part is not enough element for modules that need high execute certainty.

Tool parts are used like regular get, set and call.

To replace a part with combination of multiple parts, merge the multiple parts into a part, and use an instance of the part class.
