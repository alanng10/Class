# Single

Single is system programming language.

Single is a plat.
The plat layers below System in info tech stack arch.

Single is used to make system programming modules.

Single modules sources has port.
The port source file has file name "Single.Port".

Single module port can import Single modules.
To import Single modules, import the module classes with class names.

A Single lang source has root node that is Class node.
The Class node has no base.
It has derived Comp classes nodes in Class node.

Comp node can be struct node, var node and maide node.
Var node is global var node.

All Comp derived classes have Count.
Count has derived classes that are PrusateCount, PronateCount and PrivateCount.

Prusate count is count that is applicable to all.
Pronate count is count that is applicable to current module.
Private count is count that is applicable to this class.

Maide is shared maide. It has no this ref.
Maide has param. The param is var list.
Param var has Int type. Param var type is not declared.

Maide state can have operate.
Operate results ref.
The ref can be Int type, struct type.
If it is Int type, the ref value is Int value.
If it is struct type, the ref value is struct any memory index.

Maide call argue is passed with ref.

Maide state can have execute that has NullOperate.
NullOperate has syntax that is "null" word.
NullOperate results ref, same as other Operate.
Null is assignable to all type input of lang elements.
Null has ref value that is zero.

Int is 64 bits. Ref is 64 bits.

RefCallOperate is operate that call with ref value as maide memory index.
The call argue is passed with ref, same as CallOperate.
The call can be passed with argue that is any integer multiple of ref.
The call can be passed with argue that is any type of ref.
The call argue list count is not declared.
The call argue list type is not declared.
The call return type is not declared.
The call return type is Int type.
