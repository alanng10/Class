# Single

Single is system programming language.
Single is object oriented.
Single is class based.

Single source item root node is Class node.

Single has all Class Lang lang element nodes.
Single lang elements has same syntax as Class Lang lang elements.

Single output and input of lang elements has class, same as Class Lang.

Single builtin Int is 60 bits, same as Class Lang.
Builtin Int value is stored in ref holder ref value.
Builtin Bool value is stored in ref holder ref value.
Ref is 64 bits, same as Class Lang.

Single memory management is manual memory management.
Single NewOperate and ShareOperate memory allocation
does not have auto delete.

Single has DeleteExecute.
DeleteExecute is execute that delete any.
The execute has syntax that starts with "delete" index word, 
followed by Any of class Operate, followed by limit semicolon.
Any operate has class that is Any class.
The execute deletes the any refered by the ref value of Any operate.
If the any is Bool or Int, the execute has no effect.
After the execute is executed, using any comp of the any is programming error.

Single CastOperate is same as Class Lang.

Single System.Infra module Any class has Final maide.
The maide count is prusate.
The maide result class is Bool.
The maide has no param var.
The maide finalizes the any.
The maide results Bool true.
After this maide is called, the any comps can not be used.

Single does not need shared comp.
Single has ShareOperate that results shared instance.
This is enough element to do any share.

Single does not need struct.
Single has System modules that have classes.
The classes do no have struct in their abstracts.
This is enough element to do any inner processing.

Single does not need delegate.
Single has get, set and call that are virtual.
Get, set, and call are triggered on any.
This is enough element to do any ref call.

Single Lang does not need lang element to interface to external.
Single compiler modules have infra to generate refer binary.
The refer binary can refer to custom made machine code binary.
This is enough element to interface to external.
